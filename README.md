# RIF Relaying Services SDK sample dApp

This is a sample dApp to showcase how users can submit relayed transactions to the RSK blockchain using [RIF Relay SDK](https://github.com/infuy/relaying-services-sdk). You will need to connect to the dApp with MetaMask but only for signing transactions with the account that controls the Smart Wallets.

See [RIF Relay](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-relay) project.


## Pre-Requisites

* [NodeJS Version v12.18.3 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* [RSKj Node Running](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj).
* [RIF Relay Contract](https://github.com/anarancio/rif-relay-contracts) deployed.
* [Current Token Allowed](https://github.com/anarancio/rif-relay-contracts#allowing-tokens).
* [RIF Relay Server](https://github.com/infuy/rif-relay-server) running and registered.

## Running the sample dApp

To setup the dApp:

* Clone this repo 
* Run `npm i`

To run the sample dApp follow these steps:

1. Edit the sample dApp config file located in `.env` and add the contract addresses. By default the project imports `.env` on the `npm start`. Look for these lines and modify them accordingly:

To retrieve the value of `REACT_APP_CONTRACTS_RELAY_WORKER`, please call the `/getaddr` API against a running [rif-relay-server](https://github.com/infuy/rif-relay-server) instance and use the field `relayWorkerAddress` from the response.

E.g.:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/getaddr
```
The response has the following format:
```json
{
  "relayWorkerAddress": "0x74105590d404df3f384a099c2e55135281ca6b40",
  "relayManagerAddress": "0x4a6a175c1140f01679525ca3612364f5384cde46",
  "relayHubAddress": "0x66Fa9FEAfB8Db66Fe2160ca7aEAc7FC24e254387",
  "minGasPrice": "65164000",
  "chainId": "31",
  "networkId": "31",
  "ready": true,
  "version": "2.0.1"
}
```

2. Open a terminal in the sample dApp project root and run

```
npm start
```

3. Ensure that MetaMask is configured to use the same network where you deployed the contracts (e.g. Regtest or Testnet).

4. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Troubleshooting
### Error On Transaction Nonce
When using the RSK Regtest enviroment, it may happen that the transaction nonce is wrong. This is due to a MetaMask problem in which it saves the nonce locally and when you reset the chain the nonce is changed.

Solution:
1. Choose the account in which you have the problem
2. Enter Metamask `Advanced Settings`
3. Click on `Reset Account`. This will delete all data from the account saved in metamask, and it will look it up again on the chain. Please note that this procedure does not delete the account, but only the info gathered from the current connected blockchain.
